This automaton was developed as part of a class project for the course "Computational Theory." It is designed to search for words within a text file. As an automaton, it efficiently saves resources and operates faster than other methods. The project was implemented in C, and the design is available on GitHub. Additionally, it generates a report detailing the words found and their respective locations in the text. For the exercise, we were only provided with the list of words, not the design.
